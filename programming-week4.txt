can serialize reference

<h3>DELEGATES</h3>variables = stores value of a specific type
delegate is a variable type that stores specific method signature
explain method signatures

you're only passing a reference, so pass the name not the ()

if you ahve that variable that is not null, you can execute the method in the variable
passing methods from one class to another (can be private method)

<h3>synchronous vs asynchronous</h3>async = i want this method, but i will get result later
friendslist is a network call, will freeze game if synchronous bc it will take a while
ok go do that while i do something else etc

delegate: hey i need this, can u do this when this is done thanks
^this is a callback


if (input) {
freeze
//wait a bit
unfreeze
}

this isn't going to work, it will freeze, then immediately unfreeze

<h3>timer class</h3>public delegate void timer();
public void start(float duration, timer onComplete)	{

do like a coroutine or something
}

coroutine method {
onComplete.Invoke() //will invoke the method in this variable and will also work like onComplete()
}

<h3>events</h3>if goal, a bunch of things want to know that goal happened
we can use delegates like hey goal manager, check for goals all the time ok
here is this method, use it when goal happens

events is a list of delegates
you can subscribe to event
when event happens, everything that subscribed gets it

an event u can sub and unsub from
hey u, can i sub, heres my email (reference)?
